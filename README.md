# Programming Language Games

A collection of vaguely research-y experiments involving programming languages. Each experiment explores a single question or hypothesis and summarizes the outcome in the experiment's README.

- [minimal modern syntax](./minimal-modern-syntax) — lispy minimalism meets prefix/infix/keyword calls
- [time loop maps](./time-loop-maps) — programming with paradoxical loop values
